Appendix: ZMK¶
Glove80 is designed to work with the open-source ZMK firmware. The ZMK community (www.zmk.dev) maintains the incredible ZMK firmware.

For more details on the ZMK features, configuration and build procedures, please refer to the ZMK documentation at https://zmk.dev/docs. The ZMK community has a Discord server at https://discord.com/invite/sycytVQ.

The Glove80 fork of ZMK is maintained at https://github.com/moergo-sc/zmk.

Creating a ZMK config repo and building ZMK firmware the “traditional way”¶
The traditional way of building a ZMK firmware is by creating a Github repository for the ZMK configuration of your keyboard and then using a Github action to build the ZMK firmware. This is documented in https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup. If you use MoErgo’s Glove80 Layout Editor you don’t need to create a Github repository; please see Glove80 Layout Editor for details.

However if you prefer not to use Glove80 Layout Editor, you can build your Glove80 firmware in the traditional way. We have created a template Glove80 ZMK Configuration, which is at https://github.com/moergo-sc/glove80-zmk-config. Please follow the instructions in README.md.

This approach is particularly useful if you decide to customize your ZMK firmware.
